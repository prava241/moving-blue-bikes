# moving-blue-bikes
A way to systematically manage Boston BlueBikes demand.

The BlueBikes bikeshare app is a popular and accessible way to get around the greater Boston area. However, users may often encounter situations where there are no bikes or docks at their desired stations. Thus, the purpose of this program is to plan optimal routes for the BlueBikes company trucks to shift bikes between stations based on demand. Used methods such as linear optimization with Gurobi and map calculations with the Google Maps API. Pulled data from BlueBikes online databases.
